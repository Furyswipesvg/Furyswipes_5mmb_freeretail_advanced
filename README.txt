HOW TO RUN 5-Minute Multiboxing:
Remove geforce experience.
Set Read_Toonlist.bat to run as Administrator
Set HotKeyNet.exe to run as Administrator
May work anyway if you don't.

1) Unzip contents into your _retail_ dir
2) Edit toonlist.txt  ... put in your info. See toonlist for instructions.
3) This is weird so pay attention. In windows, drag and drop the toonlist.txt
file ONTO Read_Toonlist.bat. This is windows way of knowing what file you want
Read_Toonlist.bat to run with.
4) You will now have a new 5mmb_HKN_retail.txt hokeynet control file.
5) Double click Hotkeynet.exe
6) Click Load Script button--Load 5mmb_HKN_retail.txt
7) scroll lock on
8) ctrl-alt-m to login
10) ctrl-i to initialize all your wow buttons
11) Hit 0 key in your main window to invite/switch to free-for-all loot
12) Interface Options--turn  the annoying middle action bar off
13) alt-4 to make everyone follow/assist your main
14) Set up your dps macros in GSE. (/gse)

Retail controls are a bit similar to classic--Full classic controls here:

Extras:
Don't click update_macros.bat--you don't know what it does.

update_macros.bat goes through all your GSE macros and compiles them into one
loaded.lua file.

As you craft your gse macros you might want to pull them all together.
After you have the loaded.lua file you can copy into
Interface/Addons/Furyswipes_5mmb and all accounts will have access to them.

Warning, it only saves the first one of a given name. So, doing this will
probably overwrite the one you wanted to save. Haven't solved that yet. Maybe
I'll just save the biggest one I find.
