# YOU MUST EDIT THIS FILE TO MULTIBOX
# Each wow window is defined by a box command. (max 5)
# The box command starts with the word box.
# Then battlenet account.
# Then password.
# Then subscription name
# Then toon name.
# Then role: tank / melee / healer / caster / hunter
# You may add letters at the end 
# to launch certain boxes when you hit ctrl-alt-<letter>
# The letters are like their raid identifier. Example--The f
# at the end of furyswipes line means ctrl-alt-f only opens him
# Each toon can be in many different raids. 
# ALL BOXES ARE IN RAID m by default. This cannot be changed!
# ctrl alt m launches all your guys.
# NO ALT (special) CHARACTERS ALLOWED IN TOON NAMES!!! ONLY A-Z
# add the servername after  the toon name if they will be on different
# servers from each other using a dash (see example below)
